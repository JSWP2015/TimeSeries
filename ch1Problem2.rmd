Consider a signal-plus-noise model of the general form $x_t = s_t + w_t$, where $w_t$ is Gaussian white noise with $\sigma^2_{w}=1$. Simulate and plot n=200 observations from each of the following two models:

a.)

```{r}
set.seed(1)
s=c(rep(0,100),10*exp(-(1:100)/20)*cos(2*pi*1:100/4))
x=ts(s+rnorm(200,0,1))
plot(x)
```

b.)

```{r}
set.seed(1)
s.2=c(rep(0,100),10*exp(-(1:100)/200)*cos(2*pi*1:100/4))
x.2=ts(s.2+rnorm(200,0,1))
plot(x.2)
```
c.) Compare the general appearance of the series (a) and (b) with the earthquake series and the explosion series shown in Figure 1.7. In addition, plot (or sketch) and compare the signal modulators (a) exp{???t/20} and (b) exp{???t/200}, for t = 1, 2, . . . , 100.
