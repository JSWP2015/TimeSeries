Consider a signal-plus-noise model of the general form $x_t = s_t + w_t$, where $w_t$ is Gaussian white noise with $\sigma^2_{w}=1$. Simulate and plot n=200 observations from each of the following two models:

a.)

```{r}
set.seed(1)
s=c(rep(0,100),10*exp(-(1:100)/20)*cos(2*pi*1:100/4))
x=ts(s+rnorm(200,0,1))
plot(x)
```

b.)

```{r}
set.seed(1)
s.2=c(rep(0,100),10*exp(-(1:100)/200)*cos(2*pi*1:100/4))
x.2=ts(s.2+rnorm(200,0,1))
plot(x.2)
```
